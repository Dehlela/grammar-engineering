# Grammar Engineering

This program accepts meaningful sentences (based on a small subset in English), by analysing their grammar. It uses NLTK with Python3.

The files in the repository are as follows:

P2.py: The main program that uses the grammar in P2.fcfg and accepts meaningful sentences. It also displays parse trees of the accepted sentences.

P2_step2.fcfg: Contains pure CFG grammar (intermediate step before implementing subcategorization).

P2.fcfg: Contains final unified grammar (after subcategorization).

P2.pos: Contains a subset of meaningful English sentences that the grammar accepts.

P2.neg: Contains a subset of incorrect English sentences that the grammar rejects.
