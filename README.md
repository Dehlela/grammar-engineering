# Grammar Engineering

This program accepts meaningful sentences (based on a small subset in English), by analysing their grammar. It uses NLTK with Python3.

The files in the repository are as follows:

<b>P2.py:</b> The main program that uses the grammar in P2.fcfg and accepts meaningful sentences. It also displays parse trees of the accepted sentences.

<b>P2_step2.fcfg:</b> Contains pure CFG grammar (intermediate step before implementing subcategorization).

<b>P2.fcfg:</b> Contains final unified grammar (after subcategorization).

<b>P2.pos:</b> Contains a subset of meaningful English sentences that the grammar accepts.

<b>P2.neg:</b> Contains a subset of incorrect English sentences that the grammar rejects.
